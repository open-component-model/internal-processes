# Open-Component-Model - Internal Process Documentation

This Repo is meant for documentation of internal processes, e.g. processes regarding open-source compliance.

FYI: Only members of the "Maintainers Team" of the OCM Organisation have access to this private Repo.

## Process for creating a new Repository under the Open-Component-Model Organisation
The OSPO (Open-Source-Project-Office) of SAP has defined a certain set of rules, which need to be followed for every new repository, which is to be created under the OCM organization. We have to make sure that for new repos, we follow this process. The respective documentation can be found in [creating-a-new-repo-process.md](creating-a-new-repo-process.md).
